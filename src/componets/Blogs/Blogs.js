                                    verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The process of verifying and
                                    confirming employees ID and passwords in an organization is called authentication,
                                    but determining which employee has access to which floor is called authorization.
                                    Authentication is done before the authorization process and authorization process is done after the authentication process.
